# Jeremy Webster's Portfolio

I'm Jeremy Webster, and I developed this website to show off my projects, in a live portfolio environment. It was built using Vue.js and Tailwind CSS, as a single page website that will reactively response to viewers input and animate accordingly. 

The 3D aspects were implemented with ThreeJS, this module was utilized to allow for importation of models and materials freely into JavaScript without any unnecessary overhead allowing for easily implementation of some awesome animation.

You can view the live static website hosted by Github, here:<br>
